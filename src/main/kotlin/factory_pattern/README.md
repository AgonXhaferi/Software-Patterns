We'll probably have implementations for the 3 different types of factory method pattern types,
which are the following: 
* Simple Factory (Apparently not an actual design pattern, I'll research into it a bit more thoroughly)
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory

The whole point of factory method is the following, let's say you're trying to create an object
(mind you this is very related to track and trust), and based off of a specific attribute you would know
which class to associate that object, however initially you don't know, that's where you would use the
factory method.
 
Main points from the video:
* The classes that you're creating, as in the supertype and the
subtypes.
* And the **_way_** that you're creating them.

 The **factory method pattern** defines an interface (contract) for
creating an object but lets sub-classes decide which class to instantiate.
