Invoker **invokes** commands, commands are associated to a receiver.
The receiver then acts upon the commands.

It would be good to make comparisons between the command and the observer pattern,
taking into consideration that both of them have a part of their pattern that has a
"listener" of sorts.
Another pattern where its worth making comparisons with is the strategy pattern,
since technically speaking the commands can be taken into consideration as "**strategies**"
